Points-to analysis

Constraints:

ANYTHING = &ANYTHING
ESCAPED = *ESCAPED
ESCAPED = ESCAPED + UNKNOWN
*ESCAPED = NONLOCAL
NONLOCAL = &NONLOCAL
NONLOCAL = &ESCAPED
INTEGER = &ANYTHING
ESCAPED = &STRING
ESCAPED = &n
f_7 = i_2
f_7 = f_3
i_8 = i_2
i_8 = &NONLOCAL
i_2 = &NONLOCAL
i_2 = i_8
f_3 = &NONLOCAL
f_3 = f_7
n.0_1 = n
ESCAPED = &NONLOCAL
ESCAPED = &STRING
ESCAPED = f_3
ESCAPED = &NULL

Collapsing static cycles and doing variable substitution
Building predecessor graph
Detecting pointer and location equivalences


// The constraint graph before var-substitution in dot format:
strict digraph {
  node [
    shape = box
  ]
  edge [
    fontsize = "12"
  ]

  // List of nodes and complex constraints in the constraint graph:
"NULL";
"ANYTHING"[label="ANYTHING = { 2 }"];
"STRING";
"ESCAPED"[label="ESCAPED = { 1 3 5 9 }"];
"NONLOCAL"[label="NONLOCAL = { 4 5 }"];
"STOREDANYTHING";
"INTEGER"[label="INTEGER = { 2 }"];

Rewriting constraints and unifying variables
Uniting pointer but not location equivalent variables
Finding indirect cycles


// The constraint graph before solve-graph in dot format:
strict digraph {
  node [
    shape = box
  ]
  edge [
    fontsize = "12"
  ]

  // List of nodes and complex constraints in the constraint graph:
"NULL";
"ANYTHING";
"STRING";
"ESCAPED" [label="\N\nESCAPED = ESCAPED + UNKNOWN\lESCAPED = *ESCAPED\l*ESCAPED = NONLOCAL\l"];
"NONLOCAL";
"STOREDANYTHING";
"INTEGER";
"*__isoc99_scanf";
"f_7";
"n.0_1";
"__printf_chk";

  // Edges in the constraint graph:
"STOREDANYTHING" -> "ESCAPED";
"STOREDANYTHING" -> "n.0_1";
"f_7" -> "ESCAPED";
}


Solving graph


// The constraint graph after solve-graph in dot format:
strict digraph {
  node [
    shape = box
  ]
  edge [
    fontsize = "12"
  ]

  // List of nodes and complex constraints in the constraint graph:
"NULL";
"ANYTHING";
"STRING";
"ESCAPED" [label="\N\nESCAPED = ESCAPED + UNKNOWN\lESCAPED = *ESCAPED\l*ESCAPED = NONLOCAL\l"];
"NONLOCAL";
"STOREDANYTHING";
"INTEGER";
"*__isoc99_scanf";
"f_7";
"n.0_1";
"__printf_chk";

  // Edges in the constraint graph:
"NONLOCAL" -> "ESCAPED";
"NONLOCAL" -> "n.0_1";
"STOREDANYTHING" -> "ESCAPED";
"STOREDANYTHING" -> "n.0_1";

Alias information for main

Aliased symbols

n, UID D.2447, int, is addressable

Call clobber information

ESCAPED, points-to non-local, points-to NULL, points-to vars: { D.2447 } (escaped)
